# TinyBased

An exploration for building a more type safe wrapper around TinyBase using a fluent builder pattern.

## Inspirations

## Notes

Currently, our application stack is not fully compatible with the ES Module ecosystem. For that reason,
we are leveraging the `tinybase/cjs` imports.

If this causes issues for your project, please open an issue and let us know
